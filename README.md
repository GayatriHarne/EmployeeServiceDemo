CRUD operations on Employee data
Its very basic API for CRUD operations on Employee data
Basic authentication is implemented with base-64 credentials as Username:password
For time being, its taking password as gender and providing list of employees with gender as filter parameter
e.g female:female -> Authorization: Basic ZmVtYWxlOmZlbWFsZQ==
male:male->Authorization: Basic bWFsZTptYWxl
